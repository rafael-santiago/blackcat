v1.2.0 [git-tag: 'v1.2.0']

    Features:

        - Now GCM mode is also available. The current supported ciphers (according to user's build options) are:
          AES, CAMELLIA, RC6, MARS, NOEKEON, NOEKEON-D and SERPENT.
        - HMAC + GCM was implemented (yes, overkill but possible).
        - Two new hash functions are avaiable: Blake2s-256 and Blake2b-512.
        - New HMACs schemes based on Blake2s-256 and Blake2b-512 usage.
        - Now is possible to use an external KDF instead of the native. The available KDFs are: HKDF, PBKDF2 and ARGON2I.
        - Internal key crunching improved on.
        - Implementing repo options through .bcrepo/CONFIG file.
        - Implemented do command (command line tool).
        - Minor improvements on info command output (command line tool).
        - First-layer key was enhanced against dictionary attacks. Old repos will be automatically enhanced.
        - Windows port (no net, paranoid nor lkm commands are available).
        - Build fine tunings to easily build in OpenBSD.
        - Build improved on. Now protection layers picked during the tests are based on the ciphers selected by the user during
          the build.
        - Another build improvement. Were introduced two build compatibility files: BCDEV_PLATFORMS and SKIP_NET_TESTS.
        - Now untouch command can also change time date metainfo from directories.
        - Status output viewer by using .bcrepo/CONFIG/status-viewer.

    Bugfixes:

        - Data corruption when changing keys. Now the protection layer is always re-constructed in order to avoid this kind of
          trouble [commit-id#7fb45df].
        - Bugfix in paranoid command. The options were not being properly read [commit-id#b571fee].
        - Bugfixes related to stream ciphers Rabbit and SEAL2/3 [commit-id#29bb5e8].
        - Bugfix in a memcpy with wrong size. Sometimes it was causing heap corruption [commit-id#444b32c].
        - Bugfix related to wrong memory area returned when calculating modular inverse by right shifts [commit-id#655bf9f].
        - Bugfix related to heap corruption during RC2 key schedule [commit-id#5fde53b].

v1.0.0 [git-tag: 'v1.0.0-fix']

    Features:

        - Code re-written from its original 2006 code.
        - Now files are encrypted and gathered by using a scm concept (repository).
        - Cryptographic library also re-written.
        - More encryption schemes are available, including HMACs.
        - Available mode of operations: CBC, CTR, OFB.
        - Possibility of protecting the repository with one or two keys (keyed alike or twice).
        - Usage of key derivation functions when assembling the protection layer from the user key(s).
        - Adoption of more modern and secure hash functions.
        - The first layer key can also be authenticated with bcrypt.
        - Now cascading can be applied by using two ways (single and otp).
        - Vpn tunnel less dependent of environment conveniences (by using socket functions hooking).
        - For network encryption, E2EE also available with double ratchet like mechanism.
        - Vpn tunnel can use modified DH scheme for a session key agreement.
        - Plausibly deniable encryption.
        - Data wiping using some points observed in DoD 5220.22-M.
        - A command to set the file access time (access, creation, edition) for a default one.
        - Device driver for NetBSD, FreeBSD and Linux that enforces some paranoid cares: by detecting syscall hooking, hiding
          the files in a repository, hiding the entire repository in order to avoid data leaking (some intruder downloading
          your stuff). Enforcing the main idea: when you got a leak, it was the minimum leakage possible.
        - Now UUEncode is also a option for data encoding besides Radix-64.
        - RAM swapping mitigation by using Posix capabilities.

    Bugfixes:

        - otp dumper was not being included during the writing verification [commit-id: #b16334].
