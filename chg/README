Blackcat challange
==================

Maybe you like to say that the encryption provided by this tool is weak. The ideas behind the software are totally wrong or
you just want to audit the software in order to proof that everything is alright. The best way of doing any of those things
is by trying to break blackcat encryption. No talk, just cryptanalysis and results. This mindset is awesome, thank you!

This directory gathers some subdirectories, each subdirectory here is a blackcat repo. The challenge is simple:

                            c    r    a    c    k       t    h    e    m    .    .    .
