Blackcat user's guide
=====================

Abstract: In this document you will find basic information about how to use blackcat in order to
          protect your data.

Wtf is this?
============

Talking about cryptography, I am paranoid. I have been spending some years studying a little this
subject and more a study more paranoid I become. This tool is merely a file encryptor with my own
paranoid cares about how to actually encrypt data stored in a filesystem.

I hate letting all files unencrypted when using encrypting tools based on storage devices. If you
are paranoid like me maybe you will like the way of blackcat works.

The general approach of this tool is provide you a way of protecting an entire directory and its
sub-directories. Due to it I have designed the application to work similarly as a SCM tool,
excluding all version control stuff, of course.

OK, you do not know what a SCM tool is. Forget about the concepts. I will try to introduce you the
basic usage workflow.

The usage workflow
==================

Basically you need to create a directory into your filesystem or use a pre-existent one. For this
time we will be using a new one.

Thus, I will create a new one here:

    root@RedBarn:~/# mkdir sphinx
    root@RedBarn:~/# cd sphinx
    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# _

Now we need to turn the sphinx directory into a blackcat repo. A blackcat repo is a directory
where blackcat is able to work by locking and unlocking files among other additional operations
(more on that later). The act of turning a ordinary directory as a blackcat repo is called
initialization, initialisation or for short 'init'.

Blackcat works based on commands. All time you call blackcat you also need to specify what you
want from it. Thus, the first argument of the command line is always your intention a.k.a. the
command. If those command expects additional parameters you need to pass them too.

Let's init the sphinx directory:

    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# blackcat init \
    > --catalog-hash=sha3-512 --key-hash=sha-384 --protection-layer-hash=whirlpool \
    > --protection-layer=aes-256-cbc
    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# _

Two distinct passwords will be asked to you and after it the ordinary directory will become a
blackcat repo.

Blackcat is a unix-like tool, if it stays quiet after a command it means that the command worked.
We do not like to set fireworks when a thing works, neither celebrate with tons of exclamations!!
This is... w
            e i
                r
                 d .
                    .
                    .

After running a well-succeeded init command in an ordinary directory a sub-directory called .bcrepo
will be created. This directory stores the catalog data. You should not edit it on your own. For
example, do you have the habit of poking your cat's sandbox with your nose? So...

Maybe you are curious about the options present in the command init.

    --catalog-hash -> Specifies the hash function used by the catalog password (the first key).

    --key-hash     -> Specifies the hash function used by the user encryption key (the second key).

    --protection-layer-hash -> Specifies the hash function used internally by the protection
                               processors (key crunching, got it?).

    --protection-layer -> Specifies the algorithm or the sequence of the cascading. Yes, you can
                          specify more than one. This protection layer will be used to encrypt
                          the sensible data inside the current repository. When you specify more
                          than one cipher they need to be separated by commas.

Blackcat verifies if the combination of those three hashing algorithms are considered strong. If
not the init command will fail and you will be warned.

Blackcat uses the following algorithm naming convention:

                            <algorithm>-<bit-size-if-it-has-one>-<mode>

Blackcat also implements HMACs and (in this case) the naming convention is:

                hmac-<hash-algorithm>-<algorithm>-<bit-size-if-it-has-one>-<mode>

Until now, blackcat only implements the following encryption operation modes: cbc, ctr, ofb.
The application counts with more than one thousand encryption schemes to be used in your
protection layer.

If you do not need a barrier of two passwords you can force blackcat to use only one key. It can
be done by specifying the option flag '--keyed-alike'. By default a blackcat repo is "keyed-twice".

Now we got a directory where some files or whole files stored under it can be encrypted. However is
also possible put files without cataloging it. When you catalog a file, blackcat will track this.
The application will inform you the status of the file besides, of course, encrypt and decrypt the
related data.

The way of add a file to the repo's catalog is through the command 'add':

    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# blackcat add my-secret-spell.txt
    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# blackcat add src/p-equals-to-np-final-proof.bf
    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# blackcat add backyard/*.conf cat-memes/*.gif cat-memes/*.jpeg
    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# blackcat add YOU_SHALL_NOT_PASS_DISCLAIMER --plain

Before adding, the repo's password will be asked. Once added to the catalog the files can be protected.
If you run the command 'status' you will see that all files added are currently "unlocked".

As you can see, even sub-directories inside the blackcat repo are automatically considered if some
file inside them are added to the repo's catalog.

The '--plain' option flag indicates to blackcat that the added file(s) must not be protected. Only
indexed.

The simplest way of checking the status of the indexed files is as follows:

    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# blackcat status

The 'status' command also can be called passing a glob pattern, in cases where you have tons of files
added to catalog, a glob can be useful.

The color code used in blackcat's status report is the same of semaphores:

    - Red (stop, no one will pass there, the file data is currently locked).
    - Yellow (attention, eavesdroppers can roam freely there, you should
              lock it if you are not using the file anymore).
    - Green (go, anyone can pass, it is free).

If for some reason you have added a wrong file to the catalog or that file is not relevant anymore.
Use the command 'rm':

    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# blackcat rm cat-memes/*.gif

If you want to lock all indexed files, use the 'lock' command:

    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# blackcat lock

After typing the password(s), if correct, all non plain files will be locked.

The 'lock' command also accepts glob patterns.

In order to unlock a file use the 'unlock' command:

    root@RedBarn:~/sphinx# blackcat unlock src/p-equals-to-np-final-proof.bf

The 'unlock' command also accepts glob patterns.

A good practice is always run a 'blackcat lock' when you have just finished of accessing the repo.
Just saying, however, the data is yours and you are totally free to do anything do you want with it.

When you are not lazy and only unlock the relevant data of your repo, you are leaking the minimal
possible of the repo, if someone is silent downloading your files, this data disclore will be a
catastrophe, for sure, but not so huge as it could be. If you are paranoid about your data, it
is pretty good possibility.

Now you know all basic usage workflow:

    -> Initialize a repository.
    -> Add files to the repository's catalog.
    -> Remove them when necessary.
    -> Lock & Unlock your sensible data.

Let's move to more advanced features.
