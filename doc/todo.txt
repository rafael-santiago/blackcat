(A) Use data wiping stuff provided by liblethe. +SecurityWorries,+Improvement
(A) Use the enhanced/strengthened version of libkryptos with all new security worries. +Build,+Improvement
(A) Actually upgrade the current bcrepo metadata version when the found prior one is compatible. +Improvement
(A) Run cmd/test/main.c:blackcat_poke_libc_hooking_avoidance_tests in other Unixes besides Linux.
    Fix any found issue. (It was done. Verify if it is really okay.) +Tests,+Improvement
(B) Make fs/bcrepo/bcrepo.c:remove_go_ups_from_path() better by also considering '../thing' instead of turning it into
    './thing'. +Improvement
(B) Avoid on-line debugging when on FreeBSD, NetBSD and Linux. +NewFeature,+SecurityWorries,+FreakParanoidFeature,+Improvement
(B) Extend the fs module capabilities. +NewFeature
(C) Add elliptic curve cryptography support (ECDH and ECDSA) in net command. +NewFeature
(D) Introduce the usage of hard tokens. +DevelReverie,+NewFeature
(D) Make net tests less magical timeouts dependent. Let's make it more stable. +Improvement,+Tests
(E) Improve/implement disabling/enabling/cleaning shell history where it is not currently available. +Improvement,+NewFeature
(Z) What about roll and unroll commands? +DevelReverie
(Z) Extend net protection. +NewFeature
x (A) Implement count command.
x (A) Put a prompt in the build giving the option of re-building by preventing libc hooking. +Improvement
x (A) Implement a system test that ascertains the static linkage and the impossibility of doing hooks over
      some critical libc functions (when '--allow-bad-funcs' is not passed). +SecurityWorries,+FreakParanoidFeature,+Improvement
x (B) Perform gethostbyname() call (in skey_xchg_client()) by using dlsym stuff.
      Not implemented. It would require shared linking. +Improvement
x (A) Use static linking model where/when it is possible. +SecurityWorries,+Improvement
x (B) Do not use memset and memcpy functions. Mitigate libc hooking. +ParanoidImprovement
x (A) Encode all protection layer with radix-64 in order to avoid raw escaped chars passed during a repo initialization.
      A raw escaped char (eg.: '\xad' instead of '\\xad') could be an entry door to buffer overflows. +SecurityWorries
x (B) Make any option passed to a cipher (when a byte buffer) also able to read esc\x61ped chars. +Improvement
x (A) Make 'hungry' locks and unlocks faster (e.g.: 'blackcat lock', 'blackcat unlock'). +Improvement
x (A) Inspect why 'libbcsck.so' is aborting during its initialization in FreeBSD. Fix it if a bug. +Debug,+BugFix
x (B) Make net command's system tests also available in NetBSD, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. +Tests,+Improvement
x (B) Replace sprintf by snprintf and strcat by strncat where/when possible. +CodeSanitization
x (A) Use bcrepo_hash_key() instead of calculating it by hand in 'fs/tests/main.c:*_tests'. +Tests,+Improvement
x (A) Inspect why 'bcrepo_reset_repo_settings_tests' is breaking sometimes. Fixing it if necessary. +Tests,+Improvement
x (B) The cmd tool's show command should also list the available KDFs. +NewFeature
x (A) Investigate/Fix the weird instability of 'blackcat_poke_setkey_cmd_tests' (using 3-des). +CodeSanitization,+Improvement
x (A) Make is_hmac_processor() custom by the selected cipher suite during the build. +Improvement
x (A) Do not use DES family algorithms for catalog encryption anymore. +CodeSanitization,+Improvement
x (B) Implement the cmd tool's man command. It will print at stdout (by using less or more) 'doc/MANUAL.txt'. +NewFeature
x (B) Tuning up the build for MINIX (I find it will be pretty easy since MINIX's environment is almost like NetBSD). +Build
x (A) Document the new feature related to soft-tokens. +Documentation
x (A) Document the new command token. +Documentation
x (A) Introduce the usage of soft tokens. The sequence of those tokens will be dictated in '--soft-token' option. +NewFeature
x (A) Tidy up cmd/tests/main.c:blackcat_poking_tests by turning it into smaller system tests. +Tests
x (B) Create '--clean-modules' build option. When present it must delete all module's .o files. +Build
