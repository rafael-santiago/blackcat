(B) Make net command's system tests also available in NetBSD, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. +Tests,+Improvement
(B) Replace sprintf by snprintf and strcat by strncat where/when possible. +CodeSanitization
(B) Make any option passed to a cipher (when a byte buffer) also able to read esc\x61ped chars. +Improvement
(B) The cmd tool's show command should also list the available KDFs. +NewFeature
(B) Extend the fs module capabilities. +NewFeature
(B) Avoid directly usage of memset and memcpy functions. Avoid libc hooking. +ParanoidImprovement
(C) Add elliptic curve cryptography support (ECDH and ECDSA) in net command. +NewFeature
(D) Introduce the usage of hard tokens. +DevelReverie,+NewFeature
(D) Make net tests less magical timeouts dependent. Let's make it more stable. +Improvement,+Tests
(E) Improve/implement disabling/enabling/cleaning shell history where it is not currently available. +Improvement,+NewFeature
(Z) What about roll and unroll commands? +DevelReverie
(Z) Extend net protection. +NewFeature
x (A) Make is_hmac_processor() custom by the selected cipher suite during the build. +Improvement
x (A) Do not use DES family algorithms for catalog encryption anymore. +CodeSanitization,+Improvement
x (B) Implement the cmd tool's man command. It will print at stdout (by using less or more) 'doc/MANUAL.txt'. +NewFeature
x (B) Tuning up the build for MINIX (I find it will be pretty easy since MINIX's environment is almost like NetBSD). +Build
x (A) Document the new feature related to soft-tokens. +Documentation
x (A) Document the new command token. +Documentation
x (A) Introduce the usage of soft tokens. The sequence of those tokens will be dictated in '--soft-token' option. +NewFeature
x (A) Tidy up cmd/tests/main.c:blackcat_poking_tests by turning it into smaller system tests. +Tests
x (B) Create '--clean-modules' build option. When present it must delete all module's .o files. +Build
