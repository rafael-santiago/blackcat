"Very well, very well, I'm prepared to be silent. I'll be a silent hallucination."

My simple personal encryption tool (with my own personal "paranoid" cares).

If you are interested in it:

-> Read more about the build instructions in 'BUILD.txt'.

-> Read more about how to use the tool in 'doc/MANUAL.txt'.

Any question or problem, you can open an issue at: <https://github.com/rafael-santiago/blackcat/issues> *

This is not for comercial use. This is personal, if you want to use it check the restrictions to your
state of things, including your local country crypto regulation, the cipher license too.

Use this software at your own risk. I am not responsible for any misuse of it, including some kind of damage,
data loss, etc. Who knows your babysitter.
