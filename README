"Very well, very well, I'm prepared to be silent. I'll be a silent hallucination."

My simple personal encryption tool (with my own personal "paranoid" cares).

If you are interested in it:

-> Read more about the build instructions in 'BUILD.txt'.

-> Read more about how to use the tool in 'doc/MANUAL.txt'.

Any question or problem, you can open an issue at: <https://github.com/rafael-santiago/blackcat/issues> *

This is not for comercial use. This is personal, if you want to use it check the restrictions to your
state of things.

Use this software at your own risk. I am not responsible for any misuse of it, who knows your babysitter.
