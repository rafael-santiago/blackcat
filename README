"Very well, very well, I'm prepared to be silent. I'll be a silent hallucination."

My simple personal encryption tool (with my own personal "paranoid" cares).

Including:

    - Individual file encryption/decryption;

    - The possibility of cascading many ciphers
      (the cipher suite is configurable during the build);

    - Two ways of encrypting by cascading: single cascading, one-time based scheme;

    - HMACs for every block cipher supported. By using the following hash functions:
      SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, Tiger, Whirlpool;

    - Bcrypt is also an option for password hashing (if you like it);

    - The possibility of encoding the encrypted data by using: UUEncode or Radix-64;

    - Some level of plausibly deniable encryption (by associating some "building block" commands);

    - Assuming your system is pretty bad configured and hacked...
      A device driver that avoids your files of being downloaded after decrypted;

    - If you are pretty paranoid, some cares for avoiding RAM swap issues that would leak some
      pretty sensitive information (depending on your requirements).

    - Vpn-tunnel (socket level) with E2EE (by using a double ratchet like mechanism or not);

    - Session key exchanging by using a modified Diffie-Hellman-Merkle scheme;

If you are interested in:

-> Read more about the build instructions in 'BUILD.txt'.

-> Read more about how to use the tool in 'doc/MANUAL.txt'.

Any question or problem, you can open an issue at: <https://github.com/rafael-santiago/blackcat/issues> *

I have been using it in Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD. Anyway, you should be able to build it in any decent Unix.

This is not for comercial use. This is personal, if you want to use it check the restrictions to your
state of things, including your local country crypto regulation, the cipher license too.

Use this software at your own risk. I am not responsible for any misuse of it, including some kind of damage,
data loss, etc. Who knows your babysitter.
